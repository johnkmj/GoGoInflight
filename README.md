# GoGoInflight
Gets internet access on any gogoinflight system by spoofing a paying member's MAC address.

Experimental - actual usage isn't tested yet, but passes all tests. 

Future modifications:
Automatically extract the correct WiFi adapter name.
Tons of refactoring. 

Usage:

    sudo ruby GetInternet.rb
