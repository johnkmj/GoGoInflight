# GoGoInflight
Gets internet access on any GogoInFlight system by spoofing a paying member's MAC address.

## Experimental
No warranty nor responsibilites are assumed. This project is solely for educational purposes, and is released after the author decided to not continue it. Written in less then an hour during a flight, so everything needs to be fixed.

## Restrictions
Only works on late model Mac laptops as of now. 

## Future modifications
Automatically extract the correct WiFi adapter name.
Tons of refactoring. 

## Usage

    sudo ruby GetInternet.rb
